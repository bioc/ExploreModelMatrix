#Welcome;Welcome to ExploreModelMatrix! This tour gives an overview of the user interface.
#choose_design_formula; In this box you specify the desired (fixed-effect) design formula. The formula must start with the ~ character.
#reflevels;These dropdown menus let you set or change the reference level for each of the factor variables in the supplied sample data table.
#dropcols;This box lets you specify columns to drop from the design matrix. This can be useful, e.g., to obtain a design matrix with full rank.
#plot_height; This box sets the height of the plot window for the visualization of the fitted values.
#flipcoord;By checking this box, the x and y axes in the visualization of the fitted values are swapped. It can be useful, for example, if one factor has many more levels than the other.
#textsize;This variable changes the font size of the matrix entries in the visualization of the fitted values.
#textsizelabs;This variable changes the font size of the axis labels in the visualization of the fitted values.
#colorterms;By checking this box, the terms in the visualization of the fitted values will be show in different colors.
#linewidth;This variable sets the maximal width of a line of text in the matrix visualizing the fitted values. Longer lines will be split (splits will only be done between different terms). If the terms are colored, there will always be one term per line (corresponding to setting the maximal line width to 1).
#fitted_values_plot_box;This plot shows the fitted values, in terms of the model coefficients (or more generally, the value of the linear predictor for a generalized linear model) for each combination of predictor values. These values can be useful to derive contrasts - for example, to get the contrast required to compare the fitted values in two cells in this table, take the linear combination given in the first cell and subtract the linear combination given in the second cell. This difference will tell you which linear contrast you need to specify to perform your test of interest.
#fitted_values_table_box;This panel contains the same information as the fitted value plot, but in table format.
#sample_table_box;This panel shows the full provided sample information table.
#sample_table_summary_box;This shows the summary of the provided sample information table. Character variables are converted to factors when loaded into the application.
#design_matrix_box;This panel displays the current design matrix, obtained by the model.matrix() R function, after excluding any columns specified under "Drop columns".
#design_matrix_rank_box;Here, the rank of the current design matrix, as well as the number of columns, are displayed. If the rank is lower than the number of columns (i.e., the design matrix is not full rank), a warning will be displayed.
#pinv_design_matrix_box;This panel shows the pseudoinverse of the design matrix X. In a regular linear model of the form y=Xb+e, the ordinary least squares estimates of the regression coefficients are obtained by multiplying the pseudoinverse of X with the observed response values y, that is, $$\hat{\beta}=(X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty$$. Thus, the pseudoinverse indicates how the response variable values for the different samples contribute to the estimated model coefficients in a linear model.
#vifs_box;This panel displays the estimated variance inflation factors (VIFs) for the model coefficients, calculated by successively modeling each non-intercept column of the design matrix as a function of the other columns, using a linear model. For each variable, the VIF is obtained as 1/(1-R^2), where R^2 is the coefficient of determination of the linear model. In an ordinary least squares regression analysis, the VIF provides a measure of the increase in a coefficient's variance caused by collinearity with the other predictors in the model. The VIF for a predictor is 1 when the corresponding column of X is orthogonal to all other columns, and larger than 1 otherwise.
